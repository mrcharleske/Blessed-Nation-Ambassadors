      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Blessed Nation Ambassadors was founded in <strong>2017</strong> by <strong>Lydia Waweru</strong>.  
        Growing up in poverty and experiencing firsthand the pain of lacking basic needs, Lydia knew what it meant 
        to go without ‚Äî the struggles, the loneliness, and the longing for a helping hand.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of allowing those hardships to break her, Lydia chose to let them shape her heart with compassion.  
        She understood that many children, families, and youth around her were walking the same path she had once walked.  
        From that realization, a calling was born: <em>to be a voice of hope and a source of love to the less fortunate.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What began as a small act of kindness has now grown into a community movement ‚Äî  
        reaching out to street families, feeding the hungry, empowering the youth, 
        sponsoring children living with disability, and supporting farmers and small businesses.
