        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <img src="Images/FB_IMG_1756777405906.jpg" alt="Lydia Waweru" style="width:300px; border-radius:50%; margin-bottom:20px;">
        <p>Blessed Nation Ambassadors was founded in 2017 by Lydia Waweru, a visionary leader who turned her personal struggles into a force for good. Raised in poverty and facing numerous challenges throughout her childhood, Lydia experienced firsthand the hardships of limited access to education, food, and support. These experiences fueled her passion to create change, leading her to establish an organization dedicated to uplifting the less fortunate.</p>
        <p>Starting small with community outreach programs, the organization has grown to focus on key objectives: visiting and feeding the needy, supporting street families with guidance and resources, sponsoring children living with disabilities both academically and socially, empowering youth through skill-building initiatives, and aiding farmers and SMEs with empowerment programs to foster self-sufficiency.</p>
        <p>Today, Blessed Nation Ambassadors stands as a beacon of hope, driven by compassion, integrity, and community collaboration. We believe in creating lasting impact by addressing root causes and empowering individuals to build better futures.</p>
